What is this?
=============

This is the base docker image for [GMU_Dissertation_Pandoc_Tmpl](https://github.com/jbn/GMU_Dissertation_Pandoc_Tmpl). I use it so [travis](https://travis-ci.org) builds don't take forever from scratch. It can pull this image (which is mostly stable `apt-get`s) then layer on top.
